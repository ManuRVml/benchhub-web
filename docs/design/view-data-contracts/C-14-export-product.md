# C-14 — Export analysis product

- Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/exports`
- Triggered from: SCR-08 "Resultados" → "Descargar" buttons (HTML L720–1078); SCR-14 "Presentación · detalle" → export options (HTML L2100–2595)
- Request (minimal JSON):
```json
{
  "kind": "report-summary-xlsx|value-monitor-pdf|presentation-pptx|presentation-pdf|strategic-plan|radar-png",
  "params": {
    "analysisId": "branded-id",
    "format": "optional-format-specific-options"
  }
}
```
- `params.analysisId` is optional: `radar-png` and `strategic-plan` (Monitor de Valor, SCR-11) export monitor-scoped
  products with no analysis context. Every other `kind` still requires it, except `presentation-pptx` /
  `presentation-pdf`, which are identified by `params.presentationId` (optional in the schema, required by the BFF
  handler for those two kinds and ignored for the rest). `analysisId` is not needed for presentation exports.
- Response:
```json
{
  "operationId": "branded-id",
  "status": "accepted"
}
```
